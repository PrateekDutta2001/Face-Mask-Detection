# Face-Mask-Detection
COVID-19 human face mask detection

This Project focus of intelligent approach for detection of face mask among human being in public 
area. Deep Learning algorithm and architecture has been used over it. Convolution Neural Network (CNN) 
model and ResNet 50 as architectural model has been well trained over the image dataset and achieved a 
measurable accuracy.
